# üöÄ ngrok Setup Instructions

## Quick Start Guide

### **Step 1: Configure ngrok (One-time setup)**
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken 33bQDyBGjGsGrNXeqEVbMkqY5v7_2EAARiJ7eGPMa4stCVZ62
```

### **Step 2: Start Everything**
Run the batch file:
```bash
start_with_ngrok.bat
```

This will:
1. ‚úÖ Start your Backend API (port 8000)
2. ‚úÖ Start your Main Dashboard (port 3000) 
3. ‚úÖ Start your Reports UI (port 3001)
4. ‚úÖ Start 3 ngrok tunnels for each service

### **Step 3: Get Your Public URLs**
Look at the ngrok windows that opened. You'll see URLs like:
- **Backend API**: `https://abc123.ngrok-free.dev`
- **Main Dashboard**: `https://def456.ngrok-free.dev`
- **Reports UI**: `https://ghi789.ngrok-free.dev`

### **Step 4: Share with Anyone!**
Copy these URLs and share them with anyone, anywhere in the world!
